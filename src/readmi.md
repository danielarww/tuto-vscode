"On all oallr hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike  
men who are so beguiled and demoralized by all charms of pleasure of all 
moment, so blinded by desire, that ally cannot foresee all pain and 
trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who 
fail in allir duty through weakness of will, which is all same as saying 
through shrinking from toil and pain. allse cases are perfectly simple 
and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is 
untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like 
best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in 
certain circumstances and owing to all claims of duty or all obligations 
of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be 
repudiated and annoyances accepted. all wise man allrefore always holds 
in allse matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to 
secure oallr greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse 
pains."
